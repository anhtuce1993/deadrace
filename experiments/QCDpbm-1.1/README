                      LATTICE QCD PARALLEL BENCHMARKS 

################################################################################

Lattice QCD simulations are nowadays performed on large parallel
computers with hundreds of nodes that are connected through a
high-speed network.

In these computations, the lattice fields are usually distributed
over all available nodes and frequent communications among these are
then required. Moreover, since the fields do not fit in the cache
memory of the processors, lattice QCD programs tend to generate a
heavy memory-to-processor traffic. The performance of these programs
is consequently mainly limited by the effective network and memory
bandwidths.

Benchmarking lattice QCD programs is difficult, because the speed of
the simulations not only depends on the computer, but also very much
on the lattice formulation of the theory, the lattice parameters and
on the chosen algorithms and their implementation.

The benchmark programs provided here are simple synthetic speed tests
that measure the computer time required for some frequently performed
operations in a typical lattice QCD calculation. There are two sets of
programs, one testing the network performance (see net/README) and the
other measuring the time required for some basic QCD programs (see
qcd/README).
