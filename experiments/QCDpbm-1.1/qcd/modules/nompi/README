Checking a non-MPI function that should also be usable in an MPI
program requires a replacement for the basic utility functions.
The associated modules and include files are found in the modules/nompi
and include/nompi directories

Currently the directories with the check programs are 

misc             SU(3) matrix multiplications

random           Random number generator

sw_term          Action of 6x6 hermitian matrices on Weyl spinors
