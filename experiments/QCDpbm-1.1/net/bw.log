Node-to-node uni-directional bandwidth measurement
--------------------------------------------------

There are 5 MPI processes.

Each entry in the table reports the measured value averaged
over all possible pairs of nodes. In the case of the bandwidth,
the minimal and maximal values are given in square brackets.

Packet [KB]  Time/Test [s]  Time/Packet [ms]  Bandwidth [MB/s]   Worst Channel
