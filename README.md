# DeadRace
DeadRace was conducted to bring a new debugging approach via defining some anomalies in large-scale parallel applications and proposed techniques to detect these anomalies. Positive attaining preliminary results have shown the potential of futher developing for this debugging method. 
For practical contribution, our thesisâ€™s research results will be utilized to support the debugging in parallel applications running on the computer clusters at High Performing Computing Laboratory, Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology.
